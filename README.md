# UC Berkeley PhD thesis template

Pulled from [here](https://math.berkeley.edu/~vojta/tex/ucbthesis-phd.html)

## targets

- `all` make everything
- `pdf` make the pdf
- `clean` clean up everything

## gulp

There is a `gulpfile.js` included.
It simply runs the `all` target if anything in `src/` has changed.
